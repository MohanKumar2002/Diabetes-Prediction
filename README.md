## About The Project

This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting diabetes using a machine learning model. Users can input their health data, and the model will predict whether they are likely to have diabetes.

### Features

- User-friendly web interface built with Flask and Bootstrap.
- Input fields for various health parameters.
- Real-time prediction based on user input.

## Getting Started
